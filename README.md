# BasicImageSegmentation
## DESCRIPTION

There is an image named “tiger.png.” Use k-means clustering with k set to 16 and cluster the image, which means that you want to keep just 16 colors in your compressed image.
Objective: Open and display the image “tiger.png.” Convert the image into numpy array, so that it can be used in further processing. Find out the dimensions of the image and convert it into a two- dimensional array (Use k-means clustering for image segmentation, reducing the image to 16 colors).
